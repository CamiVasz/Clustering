abstract = {Due to the rapid progress of the e-commerce and online banking, use of credit cards has increased considerably leading to a large number of fraud incidents. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach towards credit card fraud detection in which the fraud detection is done in three phases. The first phase does the initial user authentication and verification of card details. If the check is successfully cleared, then the transaction is passed to the next phase where fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is applied to find out the normal usage patterns of credit card users based on their past activity. A suspicion score is calculated according to the extent of deviation from the normal patterns and thereby the transaction is classified as legitimate or suspicious or fraudulent. Once a transaction is found to be suspicious, neural network based learning mechanism is applied to determine whether it was actually a fraudulent activity or an occasional deviation by a genuine user. Extensive experimentation with stochastic models shows that the combined use of clustering technique along with learning helps in detecting fraudulent activities effectively while minimizing the generation of false alarms.},

abstract = {The popularity of credit card has greatly facilitated the transactions between merchants and cardholders. However, credit card fraud has been derived, which results in losses of billions of euros every year. In recent years, machine learning and data mining technology have been widely used in fraud detection and achieved favorable performances. Most of these studies use the technology of under-sampling to deal with the high imbalance of credit card data. However, it will potentially discard some relevant training samples which will weaken the ability of the classifier. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning framework based on training set partitioning and clustering. It turns out that the proposed framework not only ensures the integrity of the sample features, but also solves the high imbalance of the dataset. A main feature of our framework is that every base estimator can be trained in parallel. This improves the efficiency of the framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed ensemble framework by experimental results on a real credit card transaction dataset.},

abstract = {By increasing growth of e-commerce, which has coupled with the increase in online payments, fraud detection has become an important issue for banks. Fraud in financial transactions can cause heavy damages and endanger their reputation among their customers. Thus, focusing on a variety of fraud detection methods, as well as new ways to tackle and preventing them, is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we have proposed an unsupervised fraud detection method using autoencoder based clustering. An autoencoder with three hidden layer and a k-means clustering has been used and tested on 284807 transactions from European banks. Based on the results, the accuracy of this method was 98.9{\%}, as well as 81{\%} TPR which outperforms in comparison with others.},

@article{Kasa2019,
abstract = {Credit card fraud is a problem that can cost banks billions of dollars annually, leading to increased incentives among financial institutions for the development of fast, effective and dynamic fraud detection systems. This research paper addresses credit card fraud detection through a semi-supervised approach, in which clusters of account profiles are created and used for modeling classifiers. Accounts are profiled based on their behavioral trends and clustered into similar groups. Groups are further identified as distinct customer segments based on purchase characteristics such as amount, frequency or distance. Random forest and XGBoost classifiers are trained on an entire sample and compared against classifiers trained at the transaction level across each cluster. This research concludes that the overall weighted performance of classifiers trained at the cluster level does not significantly outperform classifiers trained on the full sample. However, this research finds that clustering can be used to find meaningful groups of account holders that also have varying fraud rates across each cluster. Additionally, some classifiers trained on specific clusters yield significant improvements in performance over the baseline, whereas classifiers for other clusters do not perform as well as the baseline. This research also concludes that the optimal classifier for a given cluster varies by cluster, highlighting the potential for further development of new classifiers which may perform well on clusters that currently exhibit underperforming models.},

abstract = {Card transaction fraud is prevalent anywhere. Even with current preventive measures like the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) chips, possible weaknesses or loopholes can be exploited by fraudsters. This paper explores Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes Classifier and clustering algorithms to detect fraud in credit card transactions. Data on fraud labels and arrival times of transactions were simulated by the Markov Modulated Poisson Process. Amounts of transactions for genuine and fraud transactions were simulated based on two Gaussian distributions. Kinds of spenders and types of fraudsters serve as the bases for the parameters used in the simulation of the data. Using the simulated data, EM clustering algorithm with three different initializations and Kmeans were applied to cluster transaction amounts into high, medium and low. The Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier algorithm was then applied to classify the transactions as good or fraud for the simulated data of 9 types of fraudsters across all clustering algorithms. Simulations and analyses were done using R software. Results include comparisons of true positive rates, false positive rates, and detection accuracies among the nine types of fraudsters across all clustering algorithms. For 3 clusters, (high, medium, low transaction amounts), the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes Method with clustering algorithms resulted to an average of 76{\%} true positive (TP) detection, 18{\%} false positive (FP) detection, with an overall accuracy of 81{\%}. The same averages of TP, FP, and overall accuracy were obtained using 2 clusters (high, and low). EM clustering algorithm generated TP, FP, and overall accuracy of 80{\%}, 16{\%}, and 83{\%} respectively. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This is a natural response to the ascendant trend in fraud activities recorded in the last couple of years, with a 13{\%} increase only in 2011. Due to ever increasing volumes of data needed to be analyzed, data mining methods and techniques are being used more and more often. One domain data mining can excel at, suspicious transaction monitoring, has emerged for the first time as the most effective fraud detection method in 2011. Out of the available data mining techniques, clustering has proven itself a constant applied solution for detecting fraud. This paper surveys clustering techniques used in fraud detection over the last ten years, shortly reviewing each one. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
